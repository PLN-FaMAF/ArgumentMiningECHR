# Argument Mining European Court of Human Rights

This is an annotation effort to develop a corpus of judgments annotated with arguments. We are applying an iterative process to refine guidelines as the annotation goes on, in order to improve the reproducibility of annotation and the stability of the automatic analyzers trained with it. This process is described in the paper below.

Annotation Guidelines can also be found below, together with the judgments annotated so far and some statistics of annotation. Up to this day, four human annotators have annotated 7 judgments from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in English, obtained from the Court website (hudoc.echr.coe.int), totaling 28,000 words.
